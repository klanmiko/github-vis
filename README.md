# GitHub Developer Story

A website that visualizes a developer's story through their GitHub profile. Displays how the languages they used evolved over time, and allow someone to gain insight on the skillset of a developer based on their GitHub profile. Also visualizes their connections on GitHub based on the links between projects, contributors, maintainers, and organizations.

This tool would be useful for someone to get an at-a-glance understanding of a developer's skills. The current GitHub contribution charts on everyone's profile looks interesting, but mostly shows how involved they are in projects, and isn't useful for understanding their experience.
