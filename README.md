# GitHub Developer Story

I want to create a website that visualizes a developer's story through their GitHub profile. I want to show how the languages they used evolved over time, and allow someone to gain insight on the skillset of a developer based on their GitHub profile. I also want to visualize their connections on GitHub based on the links between projects, contributors, maintainers, and organizations.

I think this tool would be useful for someone to get an at-a-glance look at a developer. The current GitHub contribution charts on everyone's profile looks interesting, but mostly shows how involved they are in projects, and isn't useful for understanding that person as a developer.
